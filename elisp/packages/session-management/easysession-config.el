;; The easysession Emacs package is a session manager for Emacs that can persist
;; and restore file editing buffers, indirect buffers/clones, Dired buffers,
;; windows/splits, the built-in tab-bar (including tabs, their buffers, and
;; windows), and Emacs frames. It offers a convenient and effortless way to
;; manage Emacs editing sessions and utilizes built-in Emacs functions to
;; persist and restore frames.

  ;; `file-name-handler-alist` at depth 101 during `emacs-startup-hook` or `elpaca-after-init-hook`.)
